## Appendix: Interview Questions

**Question 1**: Has there been an erosion of a common hacker ethos or has the ethos merely evolved into many different sets of ethics?

**Question 2:** In your experience with hackers, does the law offer a deterrent?

**Question 3:** Based on your experience interviewing hackers, what are their perceptions of the illegality of their activity?

**Question 4: **What types of hacking activity would you consider“ethical”?

**Question 5:** Should ethical hacking be exempt from cybercrime provisions, and if so what kinds of ethical hacking?

**Question 6:** Do you equate some forms of ethical hacking as the electronic equivalent of civil disobedience (sit-ins, protests) and if so, should the current civil disobedience framework apply to the online setting?

**Question 7: **Is there a need for security research exemption in cybercrime provisions (unauthorised access)?

**Question 8:** Is there a need for a public interest exemption in cybercrime provisions (unauthorised access)?

**Question 9:** Is there any advice in general that you wish to impart to those engaged in ethical hacking?

**Question 10:** Is there any advice in general that you wish to impart to governments and organisations in dealing with ethical hacking?

## About the Cover Image and the Artist
Serendipity brought scholarly publishing and cutting-edge art production together when we discovered the work of Phillip David Stearns.

A Brooklyn-based artist, Stearns has worked at the crossroads of technology and creativity, developing, among others, a project entitled *Glitch Textiles*, which explored the intersection of digital art and textile design.

A search for an original visual translation of the hidden digital world inhabited by hackers led us to *Fragmented Memory:* a work of art in which data, software and—stunningly—jacquard woven cotton merge into “hypothetical forms of portraiture,” to cite the artist.

“Since 2012,” Stearns said, “if anything, I’ve been seduced by the aesthetics of the algorithm.” With the author Alana Maurushat being a self-described ethical hacker and the artist developing a series of“Ethical Hacking workshops for non-technical people,” *Fragmented Memory* seemed to us the only possible cover image for this volume.

## Law, Technology and Media

* How will governments and courts protect civil liberties in this new era of hacktivism? Ethical Hacking discusses the attendant moral and legal issues. The first part of the 21st century will likely go down in history as the era when ethical hackers opened governments and the line of transparency moved by force. One need only read the motto“we open governments” on the Twitter page for Wikileaks to gain a sense of the sea change that has occurred.

    Ethical hacking is the non-violent use of a technology in pursuit of a cause—political or otherwise—which is often legally and morally ambiguous. Hacktivists believe in two general but spirited principles: respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression and personal privacy; and the responsibility of government to be open, transparent and fully accountable to the public.

    How courts and governments will deal with hacking attempts which operate in a grey zone of the law and where diferent ethical views collide remains to be seen. What is undisputed is that Ethical Hacking presents a fundamental discussion of key societal questions.

>“Many ethical hacking incidents are closely tied to the protection of human rights and the promotion of an open, transparent democracy.”

**Alana Maurushat** is Professor of Cybersecurity and Behaviour at Western Syndney University. She is also on the Board of Directors for the cybercrime investigation firm IFW Global.
