### Chapter IV 
{: .no_toc}

## Legal Cases Around the World
(with Jelena Ardalic)

Extensive case-law review revealed a paucity of reported cases on ethical hacking worldwide. Cases that were reported are published in legal databases. We looked at legal databases for all Commonwealth countries (United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, etc.) as well as the United States, Israel, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, and Germany. The lack of cases is likely due to three key factors:

1. the currency of the actions (insufficient time for a trial or a decision to have been reported in case-law databases),
1. the accused may have settled the case, or
1. the accused may have agreed to act as an informant in exchange for dropped charges.

The other important factor, as will be explored in chapter 12, is that there are many technical and legal challenges that make investigation and prosecution difficult. Hacking often includes obfuscation technologies routed through multiple jurisdictions. Attribution is the greatest challenge for cybercrime while you may be lucky enough to trace a communication to a device, device location tracking is often only accurate to a four-block radius, and even if you can drill down to a device, you must prove who the person was who used the device.

This chapter catalogues case law globally, based on jurisdiction, starting with the United States, which has the greatest number of reported cases. We itemize the cases, provide facts, then categorize the case by country, case name, citation, jurisdiction, main URL, charge, legislative provisions, main target, motivation, conviction, sentence, and additional important information.

### UNITED STATES
#### _United States of America v. Bradley Manning_

The defendant was arrested after allegedly accessing and providing classified US government documents to WikiLeaks. Private First Class Manning was a US Army intelligence analyst based in Iraq and was charged in 2010.

#### _United States of America v. Daniel Spitler and Andrew Auernheimer_

The defendants are alleged to be associates of the group Goatse Security, which, according to Wikipedia, is a grey-hat hacker group that exposes security flaws. (So, in this sense, vaguely “ethical.”)

#### _In re § 2703(d) Order (2011)_
This was a petition by Twitter users to vacate the so-called Twitter Order granted by a federal court in Virginia upon the US government’s ex parte motion. The Twitter Order required Twitter to provide the US government information relating to various Twitter accounts, including those of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, and Bradley Manning. The motion to vacate the order was denied, but the motion to unseal one docket was granted.

Also, they argued that the Twitter order violates their constitutional right to procedural due process. As well, it was argued that the Twitter order violates their first amendment rights to free speech and association. Finally, they argued that the court should exercise discretion to deny the Twitter order to avoid the above-mentioned constitutional questions.

#### _United States of America v Dennis Collins, et al. (“PayPal 14”)_
In December 2013, fourteen individuals connected with Anonymous were arrested in the United States for their alleged roles in cyber attacks against PayPal’s website in 2010. The cyber attacks were in response to PayPal’s suspension of payments to WikiLeaks and as part of a wider Anonymous campaign, “Operation Payback,” which included “Operation Avenge Assange.” Two additional individuals were arrested on similar charges.

#### _United States of America v. Raynaldo Rivera_
Raynaldo Rivera, of Tempe, Arizona—who allegedly used the online nicknames of “neuron,” “royal” and “wildciv”—surrendered to police in Phoenix six days after a federal grand jury in Los Angeles produced an indictment accusing Rivera and co-conspirators of stealing information from Sony Pictures Europe’s computer systems in May and June 2011 using an SQL injection attack. The SQL injection attack exploits flaws in the handing of data input for databases to take control of a system—in this case, against the studio’s website. The indictment says Rivera helped to post the confidential information onto LulzSec’s website and announced the intrusion via the hacking group’s Twitter account.

				<br>LulzSec released a statement related to the Sony hack. LulzSec said: &ldquo;From a single injection we accessed EVERYTHING,&rdquo; the hackers said in a statement at the time. &ldquo;Why do you put such faith in a company that allows itself to become open to these simple attacks?&rdquo;
				<br>
				<br>A number of arrests followed in the United Kingdom, where six people have been charged with various offences linked to LulzSec&rsquo;s activities.

				<br>Cody Kretsinger, who pleaded guilty to the same two charges Rivera faced, was sentenced to one year in federal prison, one year of home detention after the completion of his prison sentence, a fine of $605,663 in restitution to Sony Pictures and 1,000 hours of community service.

				<br>Hector Xavier Monsegur, a Puerto Rican living in New York, pled guilty to 12 charges, including three of conspiracy to hack into computers, five of hacking, one of hacking for fraudulent purposes, one of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one of aggravated identity theft.
				<br>
				<br>Those charges would attract a total of 124 years in jail, but he arranged a plea bargain with the US government. Monsegur received a six-month reprieve from sentencing in light of his cooperation with the government.
				<br>
				<br>Monsegur, a hacker turned FBI informant, provided the FBI with details enabling the arrest of five other hackers associated with the groups Anonymous, LulzSec and AntiSec.
				<br>
				<br>A court filing made by prosecutors in late May 2014 revealed Monsegur had prevented 300 cyber-attacks in the three years since 2011, including planned attacks on NASA, the US military and media companies.
				<br>
				<br>Monsegur served seven months in prison after his arrest but had been free since then while awaiting sentencing. At his sentencing on May 27, 2014, he was given &ldquo;time served&rdquo; for co-operating with the FBI and set free under one year of parole.

#### _Aaron Swartz_
Aaron Swartz was facing up to thirty-five years in jail for illegally downloading 4.8 million articles from the JSTOR database in 2011. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), whose data network was used in the hack, valued the downloaded information at $50,000. Aaron strongly believed that information, and especially research, should be public and free. Faced with the harsh prison sentence and under the pressure of legal fees, Aaron committed suicide at his home on January 11, 2013.

#### _R v Weatherhead, Rhodes, Gibson and Birchall_
Christopher Weatherhead (“Nerdo”)—had a leading role in plotting the attacks.

Ashley Rhodes (“Nikonelite”)—was the most “hands-on” of the four men and the only one with DDoS software on his computer. Peter Gibson—played a lesser role in the attacks.

Jake Birchall (“Fennic”)—conspired to impair the operation of computers during the attacks. Birchall was said to have a “great deal or organisational control” over “AnonOps.” His sentence was handed down at a later date, once he turned eighteen.

The four men were each convicted of attacking anti-piracy and financial companies between August 2010 and January 2011. The assaults on PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard were in retaliation for those companies cutting ties with the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks following its release of secret diplomatic cables.

#### _R v Glenn Mangham_
Glenn Mangham impersonated an employee of the social-networking site Facebook while on holiday and hacked into three of its servers. Using the code name “Gamma Ray” he stole the secret computer code “that gives Facebook its value” and downloaded it to his home computer’s hard drive. Mangham claimed that his work was“ethical hacking” and he breached the security so that he could identify vulnerabilities within the site, which the developers could then strengthen.

#### _Anonymous Indonesia and BlackSinChan_
In retaliation to the spying scandal conducted by the Australian government against Indonesian officials, including former Indonesian Prime Minister Susilo Bambag Yudhoyono, various Indonesian hacking groups targeted Australian law-enforcement websites. The attacks also targeted groups that were not involved with the spying scandal, including the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)—sparking threats from Anonymous Australia. At the time, concerns developed around the potential of cyberwarfare emerging between Anonymous Australia and Anonymous Indonesia.

### CANADA
#### _Rehtaeh Parsons Rape Case_
Canadian teenager Rehtaeh Parsons was gang raped when she was fifteen. The rapists circulated a digital image of the rape, which was shared on the Internet. Parsons committed suicide after facing years of constant torment and related bullying. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigated the for a year but said it did not have sufficient evidence to lay charges. This outraged people all over the Internet, including Anonymous. Anonymous vowed to expose the identities of the rapists online. Anonymous confirmed the identities of two of the four alleged rapists.

In the group’s statement, it claims to have seen what it calls a confession from one of the young men who allegedly admitted he raped Parsons and named three other boys who had gang raped her as well though the police only brought charges against two of the boys responsible of taking the photo and this circulating it.
